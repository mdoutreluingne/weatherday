# WeatherDay

It is a personal project that I developed to discover the world of mobile development through the Cordova framework.

It is an application that gives the weather in real time and over the following 5 days thanks to the openweathermap API that I use. This application integrates the dark mode is a detailed mode which allows to see, in a detailed way the weather forecast every 3 hours every day. If none of the modes is activated there is the default theme and an average of the temperatures is calculated each day.

I also added 2 Cordova plugins that allow you to geolocate your position to have the weather in real time and the other plugin allows you to detect if there is cellular data or Wi-Fi activated.
